### Project: StudyTracker
StudyTracker is a desktop application for students to keep track of their favourite study spots.  The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.
This project was built upon [AddressBook - Level 3](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/).
It is written in Java, and the team has contributed about 12 kLoC.

StudyTracker was built to solve the problem of not finding productive study spots.
We aim to maximise studentsâ€™ productivity by making it easy to find the best place to study.

### Feature contributions

* [**Alias feature**](https://ay2122s1-cs2103t-t09-1.github.io/tp/DeveloperGuide.html#alias-feature):
  Added an Alias Command for user-defined commands (PRs [#65](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T09-1/tp/pull/65), [#103](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T09-1/tp/pull/103))
  * **What it does**: allows the user to set custom commands to reduce typing
  * **Justification**: aliases improves StudyTracker significantly because a user can customize the program to their own needs, and complements other features (e.g. logging, editing) seamlessly
  * **Design considerations**: designing this feature required overhauling logic to parse user input, in order to maintain a list of commands in addition to user aliases 
  * **Design considerations**: I also considered whether aliases should simply map a shortcut to a single command word, or allow aliases to map to other aliases (like in Unix shell).
    [Ultimately, a middle option between the two was chosen](https://ay2122s1-cs2103t-t09-1.github.io/tp/DeveloperGuide.html#design-considerations).
    

* **Colour themes & GUI enhancements**: Designed and implemented the current GUI of StudyTracker.
Also implemented [**custom colour themes**](https://ay2122s1-cs2103t-t09-1.github.io/tp/DeveloperGuide.html#themes) using CSS to change the look of StudyTracker, along with a Style Guide for developers and designers.
(PRs [#85](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T09-1/tp/pull/85), [#92](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T09-1/tp/pull/92), [#110](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T09-1/tp/pull/110), [#131](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T09-1/tp/pull/131))
  * **What it does**: users have a built-in Settings menu to select the colourscheme of their choice.
    With the [Style Guide](https://ay2122s1-cs2103t-t09-1.github.io/tp/DeveloperGuide.html#themes-style-guide), developers can further enhance and create new themes of their own.
  * **Credits**: Team members [Joenz](joenzkimchan.md), who wrote the logic for `Help Window` and `Hours Studied Pie Chart`,
    and [Danqi](limdanqi.md), who helped with the GUI design

    When technical depth was required, I aimed to be concise and understandable.
  * **User Guide:**
    * Cosmetic tweaks to existing documentation & README, with a focus on brand voice and user-centricness: [#102](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T09-1/tp/pull/102), [#144](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T09-1/tp/pull/144)
    * Update outdated diagrams, and create annotated screenshots of StudyTracker: [#155](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T09-1/tp/pull/155)
  * **Developer Guide:**
    * Added thorough implementation details of `alias` command and Themes feature: [#96](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T09-1/tp/pull/96), [#110](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T09-1/tp/pull/110)


* **Contributions to team-based tasks**
  * Refactored existing [AB-3](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/) code to fit StudyTracker.
    This was at the beginning of the project, since a lot of the class names did not match StudyTracker's needs:
    [#22](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T09-1/tp/pull/22), [#48](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T09-1/tp/pull/48).
  * Facilitated team meetings :relaxed:


* **Non-trivial code reviews**
  * [#50](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T09-1/tp/pull/50) Improving code logic
  * [#81](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T09-1/tp/pull/81) Suggestions for code quality
  * [#90](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T09-1/tp/pull/90) Suggestions for coding standards
  * [#97](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T09-1/tp/pull/97) Identified potential UX, and consistency issues
